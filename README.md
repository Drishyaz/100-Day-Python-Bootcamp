# 100-Day-Python-Bootcamp

I started a 100 Day Python Bootcamp course on Udemy. The course requires me to complete 100 projects each day or each 2 days. Everyday as I complete a lesson, and a project, I will be posting it on GitHub, to mark my progress and also for commitment. 

Each day will be marked as 'Day-1' or with the respective day number. The code will also consist of the LIVE DEMO, you can fork my code and run it to see or yourself. The codes are available on Replit.
